Don't expect anything to happen here any more. This repo has not been deleted yet as there are a few branches left over that may be of interest:


**[jailgun_prototype2](https://github.com/schierlm/metasploit-javapayload/tree/jailgun_prototype2)**: Prototype for Jailgun (Java Railgun), see also [the same branch in Metasploit-framework repo](https://github.com/schierlm/metasploit-framework/tree/jailgun_prototype2)

**[java_war_bind_http_incomplete2](https://github.com/schierlm/metasploit-javapayload/tree/java_war_bind_http_incomplete2)**: Support for stager communication through a compromised web server (where the WAR file is uploaded to), see also [the same branch in Metasploit-framework repo](https://github.com/schierlm/metasploit-framework/tree/java_war_bind_http_incomplete2)



Or you can [continue to the master branch](https://github.com/schierlm/metasploit-javapayload/tree/master)
